# Crime-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Based-Forecasting-of-Criminal-Activities
Developed a spatial-temporal crime forecasting system using 1M+ records (2020–2024). Applied DBSCAN to detect hotspots and LSTM/ARIMA for time-series prediction. Engineered geo-temporal features, handled outliers, and evaluated models using MAE/RMSE. LSTM outperformed ARIMA, enabling proactive policing insights.
